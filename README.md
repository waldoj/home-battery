# Setting Up a Home Battery

Figuring out how to install a home battery bank for a PV array.

## Overview

The idea is to modify a net-metered home-solar setup to add a battery bank, for the purpose of reducing the amount of power that is sold back to the power company (and then re-purchased from them). Batteries will smooth out the mismatch in the spikes between power generation and power use, reducing the total amount transferred to and from the power company. I have some interest in also using the battery bank as a backup power source for the home, but the presence of a whole-house generator makes that less interesting.

The PV array is 14 Sunmodule Plus SW 280 mono panels, with a total capacity of 3.92 kW, with the following specs:

* STC Rating: 280.0 Watts
* PTC Rating: 251.2
* Open Circuit Voltage: 39.5 Volts
* Short Circuit Current:	9.71 Amps
* Power Tolerance	0/+5%
